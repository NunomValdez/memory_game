# Memory Game Project

Welcome to the Memory Game Project! This project is a dynamic web app that utilizes the Pexels API to fetch and display images. Follow these setup instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Setting Up the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**

2. **Install Dependencies**
   - Navigate to the root directory of the project.
   - Run `npm ci` to clean install the project dependencies.

3. **Setting Up Environment Variables**
   - You will need a Pexels API key to run this project.
   - Visit [Pexels API page](https://www.pexels.com/api/new/) and sign up to get your API key.
   - Once you have your API key, create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
